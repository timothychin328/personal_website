I am a first-year master's student in [Statistics](https://stat.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-programs/degree-programs/ms-statistics) at the University of Illinois. 
  
From 2017-2018, I worked as an undergraduate intern in [State Farm Insurance's](https://www.statefarm.com/) Property and Casualty Actuarial department from 2017-2018 while completing my bachelor's degree. Starting from January 2019, I have been a MAGNet intern in State Farm's Strategic Resources department. Both these internships are located at [State Farm's Research and Development Center](https://rdc.statefarm/#!/home) in Champaign, IL.  
  
My undergraduate research experience involved working with Clinical Professor of Economics [Jose Vazquez](https://chroniclevitae.com/people/194561-jose-vazquez/profile) on the economics of education.
