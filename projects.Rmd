### Internship Description

My undergraduate internship in the Property and Casualty Actuarial department at State Farm lasted from January 2017 to December 2018. I worked on a variety of group projects that involved a combination of actuarial analysis and data visualization. Projects were streamlined to follow the process of data querying, cleaning, analysis, model comparison, and presentation of results. Over the course of the two years, I worked with a variety of software, not limited to SQL, R, SAS, Python, and Microsoft Office. 

Since May 2018, I was placed in a lead intern role where I would mentor undergraduate and graduate interns throughout the course of the semester project. Additional responsibilities included the following:   
  
* Leading in-person scrum meetings
* Writing weekly status updates to management
* Conducting online meetings with actuaries and statisticians situated in the company's corporate headquarters
* Overseeing a presentation of project results in front of department leadership  


Starting in January 2019, I continued my work at State Farm as a Modeling and Analytics Graduate Network (MAGNet) intern in the company's Strategic Resources department. I continue to work on a variety of analytics-based projects centered around machine learning algorithms and model validation.

### Research Description

From October 2015 to February 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant to Clinical Professor of Economics Jose Vazquez. His research was primarily centered around the economics of education, particularly in the areas of e-learning and student engagement. The research project that I worked on with him invovled determining the effect of a proctor on grades in an online and face-to-face course. I conducted extensive literature reviews and experimental designs motivated from a variety of academic journals, including the American Economic Review, Quarterly Journal of Economics, and the Journal of Economic Education. Additional responsibilities included filing all documentation required for the university's IRB approval of our experiments for the duration that I was his research assistant. 

We were able to present our findings from our clinical study at the 87th Annual Southern Economic Conference in Tampa, FL in November 2017.
